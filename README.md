# CCH-MCRP
## Chris Hall's Minecraft Resource Pack
This is my on-going Minecraft resource pack. My aim is to improve the consistency of the game. For example, I rename "Oak Tree" to "Fruit Tree" so that it is more logical for the branches to produce apples when destroyed.

## Minecraft Versions Supported
Minecraft 1.10 - 1.13

## Permissions & Redistribution
Anyone is free to use this resource pack in their own Minecraft game.
