## Chris Hall's Minecraft Resource Pack
This is my on-going Minecraft resource pack. My aim is to improve the consistency of the game with a lightweight resource pack. For example, I rename "Oak Tree" to "Tree" so that it is more logical for the branches to produce apples when destroyed.

## Features
* Trapdoors are camouflaged! Perfect for secret doors!
* 3D doors in inventory
* Renamed "Oak" trees/wood to generic name (so it's more plausible to get apples from them)
* Wooden sword is now a club, stone sword is now a mace
* Mob spawners look like mini-nether portals, giving new players a clue on how to make nether portals
* Changed "Spruce" to "Pine" and changed associated textures to resemble pine wood
* "TNT" is now "Bomb", "Gunpowder" is now "Black Powder"
